# About Lien Flash
This Front End aspect of this app is hosted @ https://lienflash.herokuapp.com/  
Lien Flash is an application that makes a difficult and arduous legal task easy.  
Often after a contractor finished a job for a client the bill is not fully paid (or sometimes not at all!) If this is the case there is a legal process one must take if they wish to take the client to court with strict deadlines. First the client must have their lawyer file a "Notice of Intent to File a Lien." After that they must then actually File the Lien within the courts.  
Enter Lien Flash - This application makes it easy for contractors to track multiple jobs with ease.  
Upon entering a job into the app the user will then receive a series of text messages and emails reminding them of the approaching deadlines. If the user decides to move forward with the legal process their attorney handles the rest.  


# Current known issues / limitations 
Needs admin functionality.  
Needs to increase testing (currently around 97% but 100% is always our goal!)  
Payment processing needs to be added to make app a monthly subscription service.
